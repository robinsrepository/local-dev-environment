    <h3>Commit</h3>
    <p>GitHub makes an official record of your changes.</p>
    <h3>Push</h3>
    <p>GitHub publishes the commits you've made. By clicking the "History" tab in the GitHub Desktop, you can view all your commits.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Deploy</h3>
    <p>Once you've pushed your changes to GitHub, you can make your code available on a server so that others can view the website online. I do this with GitHub Pages: my code is uploaded to a special place where GitHub automatically converts it into a working website.</p>
