    <h1>Local Dev Environment</h1>
    <h2>Text Editor</h2>
    <p>To edit your code on your pc, I do this with Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <h2>Version Control</h2>
    <p>I use it to keep changes updated on GitHub, using GitHub Desktop.</p>
    <h3>Commit</h3>
    <p>GitHub makes an official record of your changes when you commit them. Don't forget to save your changes in VSC before you do this. By clicking the "History" tab in GitHub Desktop, you can view all your commits.</p>
    <h3>Push</h3>
    <p>GitHub publishes the changes in your files and commits you've made on GitHub when you push them.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Deploy</h3>
    <p>Once you've pushed your changes to GitHub, you can make your code available on a server so that others can view the website online. I do this with GitHub Pages: my code is uploaded to a special place where GitHub automatically converts it into a working website.</p>
